# Gamesys Opt In App

The app contains one class based component called 'OptIn'.

It pulls data from the optin.json file located at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjosity/optin/main/optin.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjosity/optin/main/optin.json) however there is an optin.json located in the public directory that can also be used (update Axios' get method in OptIn.js line: 19). This can be updated to change and update content as needed without having to run the build process

The component stores the timer value in the browser's local storage. For testing pruposes once the timer starts in order to reset you would need to delete the object from your local storage (different browsers have different methods of doing this)

## Additional Packages/3rd Party Libraies

- [AXIOS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Used to fetch JSON data for the app's content
- [React Countdown](https://github.com/ndresx/react-countdown) - Used for timer component
- [SASS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) - Used for app styling
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - Used for animation to transition out elements on timer complete

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
